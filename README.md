# Arduino_DoorLock_OpenCV

This project attempts to simulate a door lock system in Proteus using facial recognition. The facial recognition component is handled in Python and uses serial communication
to establish a connection with the Arduinon module in proteus using the **COMPIM** component.

_I plan on finishing this later..._
